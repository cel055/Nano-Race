I've added the necessary mail A record and pointed that to your cPanel IP already. It can take 24-48 hours for that to propagate, but it's usually done sooner.

In the future if you have issues with cPanel, including cPanel email, you'll want to select Hosting in the pre-chat survey. That will direct you to our hosting department automatically when they're available. If the hosting department is not available for chat, then you would need to call in to (480) 505-8877. Phone support is available 24/7.
